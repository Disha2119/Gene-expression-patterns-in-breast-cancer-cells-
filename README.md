Gene Expression Analysis of Breast Cancer Cells
This project explores gene expression profiles in breast cancer cell lines to identify biomarkers associated with drug resistance. Using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, the goal is to distinguish between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant breast cancer cells based on gene expression data.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
To investigate whether gene expression patterns in breast cancer cells differ between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive groups, and to determine if machine learning models can predict drug resistance based on gene expression data.

ðŸ§¬ Dataset
Source: kaggle.com

Cell lines: BAS, HS578T, MCF7, MDA-MB-231

Columns included:

Gene: Gene symbols
